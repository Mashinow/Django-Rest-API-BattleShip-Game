# My Course Project: BattleShip Game with REST API

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository where I've shared my course project, a BattleShip game built with REST API. This project, which I recently defended with excellence, showcases my skills in game development and API integration.

## Project Overview
The game, inspired by the classic BattleShip, operates through a REST API, ensuring a seamless and interactive gaming experience. It's developed using Python 3.10 and features two main components:

- **Server-Side**: Crafted with Python 3.10 and Django, the server-side manages game logic, player interactions, and data handling.
- **Client-Side**: The client-side, built with Python 3.10 and PyQt5, offers a user-friendly interface for engaging gameplay.

## Features
The current version of the game includes several exciting features:

- **Manual or Random Ship Placement**: Players have the flexibility to manually set their ships on the board or use the random generation feature for quick setup.
- **Single-Player Mode**: Engage in a solo game against a computer-controlled opponent, testing your strategy and skills.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Compete with other players in real-time, enhancing the challenge and excitement.
- **Game History**: Review past games to analyze strategies or relive victorious moments.

## Installation

To get started with the BattleShip game, clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies for the server and client, and then run the respective `main.py` files. Follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [URL to Repository]
   ```

2. Navigate to the server directory and install its dependencies:
   ```
   cd path/to/server
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Then, navigate to the client directory and install its dependencies:
   ```
   cd path/to/client
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the server's `main.py`:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

5. Open a new terminal, navigate to the client directory, and run the client's `main.py`:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

Now, you should be able to play the game. While Python 3.10 is recommended as it is the version used during development, other versions may work but have not been tested for compatibility.
