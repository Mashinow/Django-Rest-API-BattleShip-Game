# My Course Project: BattleShip Game with REST API

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository where I've shared my course project, a BattleShip game built with REST API. This project, which I recently defended with excellence, showcases my skills in game development and API integration.

## Project Overview
The game, inspired by the classic BattleShip, operates through a REST API, ensuring a seamless and interactive gaming experience. It's developed using Python 3.10 and features two main components:

- **Server-Side**: Crafted with Python 3.10 and Django, the server-side manages game logic, player interactions, and data handling.
- **Client-Side**: The client-side, built with Python 3.10 and PyQt5, offers a user-friendly interface for engaging gameplay.

## Features
The current version of the game includes several exciting features:

- **Manual or Random Ship Placement**: Players have the flexibility to manually set their ships on the board or use the random generation feature for quick setup.
- **Single-Player Mode**: Engage in a solo game against a computer-controlled opponent, testing your strategy and skills.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Compete with other players in real-time, enhancing the challenge and excitement.
- **Game History**: Review past games to analyze strategies or relive victorious moments.
